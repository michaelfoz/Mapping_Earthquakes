# Mapping_Earthquakes
Please view my  Earthquake_Challenge folder for the Module 13 Challenge here: [Earthquake_Challenge](https://github.com/michaelfoz/Mapping_Earthquakes/tree/main/Earthquake_Challenge)

The purpose of this repository is to house all of the code I worked on throughout the Module. The Module demonstrates how to map GeoJSON data on the browser via the index.html file. (JavaScript code is writtedn to make an API call to Leaflet and then display the data onto the index.html file.)

Below, are the 3 map tile layers for the Challenge (I had to zoom into the map because the Streets layer and the Outdoors layer look very similar when the map is left at the central global view.) The challenge starter code was pre-written to have the Streets and Satellite Layers. Per the assignment's instructions, I had to create a 3rd tile layer wherein I chose the Outdoors tile layer.
