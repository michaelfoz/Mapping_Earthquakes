Steps:

    (1) Create Repo: Mapping_Earthquakes
            (2) Create branch in Mapping_Earthquakes repo called: Simple_Leaflet_Map

    (3) Create Simple_Map folder within Mapping_Earthquakes repo.
            (4) Create index.html
                    (5) inside index.html, type "!" then press "enter"
                        to populate HTML5 boilerplate code; change the of the document
                        in the <title> element (in the <head> section) from <title>Document</title>
                                                                        to <title>Leaflet-Basic-Map</title>
                    
                            (6) Go to https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/
                                and add the Leaflet JavaScript Library into the index.html file

                                In the <head> section, just below the <title> element, 
                                add the following Leaflet CSS script from the "Preparing your page" section:

                                (a) In the <head> section, just below the <title> element, 
                                    add the following Leaflet CSS script from the "Preparing your page" section:

                                    [comment] (a) Leaflet CSS [end of comment]

                                (b) In the body of our index.html file, add the Leaflet JavaScript script:
            
                                    [comment] (b) Leaflet JavaScript [end of comment]

                                (c) Above the Leaflet JavaScript link script, add the following 
                                    <div> element with the id tag for the map, as shown in the "Preparing your page" section:

                                    [comment] (c) The div that holds our map [end of comment]
                                    <div id="mapid"></div>

    Create a Simple Map (Module 13.2.4): to create a map, need to create config.js and logic.js

    (7) Simple_Map/static/<create (js) folder>
    
    (8) Simple_Map/static/js/<create (config.js)>
            (The config.js file is like the config.pyfile we used to hold the OpenWeatherMap API and Google API keys.)
    
                (9) Inside config.js, add API key from mapbox

    (10) Simple_Map/static/js<create (logic.js)>

                (11) Inside logic.js, add:
                
                    // Add console.log to check to see if our code is working.
                    console.log("working");
            
                        (The console.log() function with the phrase "working" inside the parentheses will 
                        help us confirm that our logic.js file is being accessed in the console on Chrome.)
                        
                (12) Inside logic.js, add a Map Object

                (13) Inside logic.js, add a tile layer for the map

    (14) Allow our index.html file to use the config.js and logic.js scripts (Add JavaScript Tags to HTML Page).

        (d/e) Add the following <script> elements below the 
              Leaflet JavaScript link script and above the closing </body> element, and save the file:

                [comment] (d) API key [end of comment]
                <script type="text/javascript" src="static/js/config.js"></script>
                [comment] (e) Our JavaScript [end of comment]
                <script type="text/javascript" src="static/js/logic.js"></script>

    (15) Create new branch within Simple_Map folder (Mapping_Single_Points folder):

            (16) Copy/paste contents of Simple_Map folder into Mapping_Single_Points folder.

    (17) Add a Marker to the Map (logic.js file)

            //  Add a marker to the map for Los Angeles, California.
            let marker = L.marker([34.0522, -118.2437]).addTo(map);

                (18) In the logic.js file, add a circle to the map

                        L.circle([34.0522, -118.2437], {
                        radius: 100
                        }).addTo(map);

                (19) Create a light-yellow circle with black lines indicating a 300-pixel radius on a dark map.
 
                        L.circleMarker([34.0522, -118.2437], {
                            radius: 300,
                            color: "black",
                            fillColor: 'ffffa1'
                        }).addTo(map);

    (20) Create new branch within Simple_Map folder (Mapping_Multiple_Points folder):

            (21) Copy/paste contents of Mapping_Single_Points folder into Mapping_Multiple_Points folder.

    (22) Add Multiple Markers to the Map (logic.js file)

            Replace the [marker] variable (which was used to map one location) with the [cities]
            (The [cities] variable references the 5 most populous cities array in the code below):
 
                // An array containing each city's location, state, and population.
                let cities = [{
                location: [40.7128, -74.0059],
                city: "New York City",
                state: "NY",
                population: 8398748
                },
                {
                location: [41.8781, -87.6298],
                city: "Chicago",
                state: "IL",
                population: 2705994
                },
                {
                location: [29.7604, -95.3698],
                city: "Houston",
                state: "TX",
                population: 2325502
                },
                {
                location: [34.0522, -118.2437],
                city: "Los Angeles",
                state: "CA",
                population: 3990456
                },
                {
                location: [33.4484, -112.0740],
                city: "Phoenix",
                state: "AZ",
                population: 1660272
                }
                ];

                    (23) Iterate through each city object and add each city location to the 
                         marker() function, which will, in turn, be added to the map.

                        // Loop through the cities array and create one marker for each city.
                        cities.forEach(function(city) {
                            console.log(city)
                        });

                    (24) Now, add each city's location to the map by adding the location to the marker() function.

                        // Loop through the cities array and create one marker for each city.
                        cities.forEach(function(city) {
                            console.log(city)
                            L.marker(city.location).addTo(map);
                        });

            (25) When handling large datasets, it's a best practice to have the data in an external file and refer to that file and dataset in the logic.js file.
                
                Even though the cities array is not that large, go ahead and 
                create a new file in the "js" folder called "cities.js"

                Cut the cities array data from the logic.js file, 
                place it in the cities.js file, and save the file.

                    (26) in logic.js:

                        // (10th code added):
                        // Get data from cities.js
                        let cityData = cities;


                    (27) in logic.js:

                        // (11th code added--Now the cities array is assigned to the cityData variable, which means cities needs to be replaced with cityData in the forEach() function): 
                        // Loop through the cities array and create one marker for each city.
                        cityData.forEach(function(city) {
                            console.log(city)
                            L.marker(city.location).addTo(map);
                        });

                    (28) Intentional: receiving an "UncaughtReferenceError: cities is not defined" in the console when opening index.html
                        
                            To correct this error, in the body of the index.html file and before the path to the logic.js script, 
                            add a <script> file with the path to the JavaScript cities.js file, like this:

                            <script type="text/javascript" src="static/js/cities.js"></script>

    (29) Bind a Popup to the Marker (in the logic.js file):

            Add this code inside the .forEach() function:

            .bindPopup("<h2>" + city.city + ", " + city.state + "</h2> <hr> <h3>Population " + city.population + "</h3>")
            
            (When clicking on each marker, it will show the name, state, and population of the city.)

        
        (30) Format the population with a thousands separator by using the toLocaleString() 
             method on the city.population in the bindPopup() method

            .bindPopup("<h2>" + city.city + ", " + city.state + "</h2> <hr> <h3>Population " + city.populationtoLocaleString() + "</h3>")

        
    (31) Change the marker for each city to a circle that has a radius equivalent to the city's population
        
                (In the logic.js file):

                replace the marker() function with the circleMarker() function in the forEach() function 
                
                Then assign the "radius" key to the population by using city.population


                    (32) Divide population by 100000 (because the map isn't populating correctly--
                        the radii are too large and don't fit the map)

                        radius: city.population/100000
